# Feature: Add Reset Button to Score Keeper Application

## Description

Currently, the Score Keeper application allows users to increase or decrease the score for two players. However, there is no option to reset the scores to 0 without refreshing the page. A "Reset" button would improve the user experience by allowing users to reset the scores directly from the interface.

## Feature Requirements

- Add a "Reset" button below the player scores.
- When clicked, the "Reset" button should set both player scores back to 0.
- The button should not reload the page.
- Ensure that the reset functionality works alongside the existing increase/decrease buttons.

## Steps to Reproduce the Issue (for Bug Fixes)

N/A â€“ This is a feature request.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that the design of the reset button aligns with the existing UI (consider using the same styles as the existing buttons).
